``` npm install ```
  - create an .env.local file
  - here create a variable called ``` NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY ``` and set it equal to your API key from openai
  - from here you should be able to run ``` npm run dev ``` and start up a local server and start prompting the AI to generate components
